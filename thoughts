what we are going to build on our website

Our website will have the options to log in and sign up as a user. Every user
has an investment pool. The pool replenishes slowly over time. Every user has
the chance to invest on fads as they are uploaded. By investing on them,
they are effectively buying "shares" on the fad. As the likes on the
fad grow, so do their shares. Users are allowed to like anything
they please, but they can only invest on so many fad at a time.

Once uploaded, a fad can be invested in or liked. It will automatically
be watermarked in an incospicuous way, such that any edited reuploads may still
be identified with the original. This allows is to track the popularity of
the fad on different sites. if the picture attains a particularly large
amount of upvotes on reddit/likes on Instagram/whatever, this will be reflected
on the value of the picture on the original site as well. Each like is like the
user buying the fad.
